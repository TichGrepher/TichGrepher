		<p class ="one">To start let me lightly describe the gist of the overall game series.<br><br>
		The Legend of zelda as a whole is generally a adventure game usually revolving around several small conflicts culminating into the central plot of each game.<br> Each of the games
		usually has a original setting or theme in some of them but the core mechanics usually remain the same including the titular character Link though in some games you may name them yourself.<br> You can visit the following game pages either through the pictures below or the menu at the top.</p><br>
		
		<p class = "two">Below I will have options to go to seperate pages illistrating some of my top three games from the collection. Click on them to go to the page.</p><br><br>
